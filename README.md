# yoobic-test
Mini-test for yoobic recrutment process : Small app with ionic

* Started with template tutorial from ionic (Page Hello/List/Details).

* Modify Hello page to do the login page (Unfortunately, it has been complicated to change the name of the page, so it remains the same)
* Implement only email/password authentication with Firebase (Test account send by message on talent), no sign-up, no error message if wrong credentials.

* Modify List to print Information from the api : https://pokeapi.co/ , API response-time can be very slow sometimes
*Modify detail to print Information from the api (But only one element)
(Fake social buttons, and option button)

*Do menu looks like the wireframe (Fake logout button, Chat redirects to Chat page, other to list)

*Do chat page (Thanks to https://www.djamware.com tutorial) with firebase database (Fake button photo)
